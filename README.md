## Monte Carlo Simulation with VaR

#### Risk Modeling & Stress Testing with Statistical Simulation

##### PROJECT OVERVIEW:

- Purpose: Test Monte Carlo simulation effectiveness for Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimation by comparing simulated risk predictions against actual S&P 500 market performance.
- Objective: Validate normal distribution assumptions in risk modeling and identify limitations through breach rate analysis, demonstrating when Monte Carlo methods capture typical risk versus extreme tail events.

##### DATA SOURCES:

- Primary: S&P 500 (SPY) daily price data from August 2020 to August 2025
- Analysis Period: 5 years of daily returns (1,255 trading days)
- Statistical Parameters: Mean daily return (0.06%), volatility (1.10%), skewness (0.23), excess kurtosis (8.30)
- Simulations: 100,000 Monte Carlo scenarios generating 125.5 million data points

##### TECHNOLOGIES USED:

Core Stack:

- Python - Primary simulation and analysis environment
- numpy - Monte Carlo random number generation and statistical calculations
- pandas - Data manipulation and time series analysis
- matplotlib - VaR visualization and breach rate plotting

Statistical Libraries:

- scipy.stats - Distribution analysis and statistical testing
- yfinance - S&P 500 historical data retrieval

Development Tools:

- Jupyter - Interactive analysis environment
- Git - Version control and collaboration
